what happen if we moved the constructor in the private section?
 - don't run code

what happen if we moved the copy constructor in the private section?
 - we can't copy the object
 
C++ won't allow you to not use & in copy construtor?
 - because copy constructor is function which has parametar 
     So if we pass an argument by value in a copy constructor, a call to copy constructor 
	   would be made to call copy constructor ==> infinite recursion
 
C++ don't force you to use const, why?
 - objects are not accidentally modified
 - It gets executed but copy constructor is not called, instead it calls the default constructor where assignment operator is overloaded.
